Menstrual Hygiene Data Collection Web Application
Project Overview
This project is a simple and interactive web application designed to collect menstrual hygiene data from young teens. The web app functions similarly to a Google Form, allowing users (young teens) to submit information about their menstrual hygiene practices in a safe and private way.
The goal of this application is to make data collection easy, accessible, and empowering. It uses a simple and clean UI designed to make users feel comfortable.
Purpose and Impact
This project aims to promote awareness, record real experiences, and support better menstrual health education and policy decisions through data.
The application supports menstrual health education by:
• Helping collect real-world data from teens in different schools and communities.
• Highlighting areas where access to sanitary products and awareness is low.
• Encouraging open conversations about menstrual hygiene management.
The resulting insights from the collected data can help schools, NGOs, and health programs design better interventions.
Features
The web application includes the following core functionalities:
• User-friendly form interface.
• Secure data submission.
• Data view or export for analysis.
• Responsive design.
• LocaL data storage
