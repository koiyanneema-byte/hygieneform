# Menstrual Hygiene Data Collection Web Application

## Project Overview  
This project is a **simple and interactive web application** designed to collect **menstrual hygiene data** from young teens.  
It functions similarly to a **Google Form**, allowing users to submit information about their menstrual hygiene practices **safely and privately**.  

The goal of this project is to make data collection **easy, accessible, and empowering**, using a clean and minimal interface that ensures users feel **comfortable and respected** while providing information.

## Purpose and Impact  
The **Menstrual Hygiene Data Collection Web App** aims to **promote awareness, record real experiences**, and support **better menstrual health education and policy decisions** through meaningful data insights.  

### This project helps by:
-  **Collecting real-world data** from teens in different schools and communities.  
-  **Highlighting areas** where access to sanitary products and awareness is limited.  
-  **Encouraging open conversations** about menstrual hygiene management.  

The insights gathered from this platform can help **schools, NGOs, and health programs** design more effective interventions and advocacy programs.

##  Features  
The web application includes the following core functionalities:

-  **User-friendly form interface** — clean and intuitive for young users.  
-  **Secure data submission** — ensuring privacy and confidentiality.  
-  **Local data storage** — for simple and offline-safe data handling.  
-  **Data view and export** — enabling analysis for research or reporting.  
-  **Responsive design** — accessible across phones, tablets, and computers.

##  Tech Stack  
This project is built using front-end web technologies to keep it lightweight and easy to deploy anywhere:

- **HTML5** – Structure and content  
- **CSS3** – Styling and responsive layout  
- **JavaScript** – Form interactivity and local data management

##  How It Works  
1. Users (teens) access the web app via a secure link or device.  
2. They fill in the menstrual hygiene form — providing information on access, challenges, and practices.  
3. Data is securely stored and can be exported for further analysis or visualization.  
4. Administrators or researchers can then use this data to create reports and inform awareness programs.

##  Future Improvements  
-  Integration with a **cloud database** for centralized data collection.  
-  Development of **data dashboards** for visualization and analysis.  
-  Addition of **multi-language support** for inclusivity.  
-  Building a **community feedback section** to share stories and advice.
